# CS 107 Computer Architecture and Organization

The organization and behavior of real computer systems at the assembly-language level. The mapping of statements and constructs in a high-level language into sequences of machine instructions is studied, as well as the internal representation of simple data types, pointers, structures, and non-numeric data. Numerical computation is also examined.
